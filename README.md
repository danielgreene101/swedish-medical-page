# Werlabs Frontend Developer assignment

### What's in your assignment pack

`index.html` - the starting point with `<head>` assets and a "skeleton" markup.

`css` - the slick.css and slick-theme.css + of course your generated `werlabs.css`.

`images` - the images for the view, out of which most are already requested by the markup.

`js` - jquery + slick js for the carousel.

`screens` - the screens shots of the finalised view.

`scss` - your styling starting point with defined colours and the font to use for headings and copy.


### Task

How would you reproduce the view in the screen shots in the `screens` dir?

**Requirements**

- Style the view at mobile (375px screen width) and desktop (1200px screen width).

- Add classes to the markup and style the view using `werlabs.scss` with the font and the colours defined within.

- You are free to remove markup but we'd prefer if you don't add levels of html.

- Use `gulp` to transpile `werlabs.scss` to `/css/werlabs.css` (Using `npm install` for dependencies and gulp default task, `gulp`)

*Bonus Points*

- Use as many scss (sass) features as are reasonable for this assignment.

- Add css minification to the gulp setup.


### Important to note

The main objective of this assignment is not for you to prove that you can reproduce a design pixel-perfectly. Of course an understanding of design is required but your level of curiosity and ability to learn are more important. In the assignment task we are specifically looking for:

- Ability to abstract when naming classes. Reusability is important. Imagine that you are making reusable sections that can be inserted on other views.

- Ability to quickly prototype a view with a good enough representation of a design, for multiple screen sizes and with thought out transitions.

We'll be viewing the result on iphone 6/7/8 in Simulator on Mac and on latest Chrome on Mac. Cross-browser and browser backwards compatibility are important but not a primary in the scope for this assignment. If you use "edge" CSS then please have a fallback for IE10+.
